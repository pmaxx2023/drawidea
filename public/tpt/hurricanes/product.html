  <h2 class="passage-title">Hurricanes: Big Storms from the Sea</h2>
  <div class="passage-text">
    <p>A hurricane is a very big storm. It forms over warm ocean water. Hurricanes have strong winds and heavy rain.</p>
    <p>How does a hurricane form? First, the sun heats the ocean. The water must be at least 80 degrees. Warm, wet air rises up from the water. As it rises, it starts to spin. More and more air joins in. The spinning gets faster. When the winds reach 74 miles per hour, it becomes a hurricane.</p>
    <p>Hurricanes have different parts. The center is called the eye. The eye is calm and quiet. But the area around the eye is the worst part. This is called the eyewall. It has the strongest winds and rain.</p>
    <p>Scientists put hurricanes into groups. They use numbers from 1 to 5. A Category 1 storm is the weakest. A Category 5 storm is the strongest. Category 5 hurricanes have winds over 157 miles per hour. They can destroy buildings and knock down trees.</p>
    <p>Hurricanes are dangerous. They bring flooding from heavy rain. They also cause storm surge. This is when ocean water pushes onto land. Storm surge can be 20 feet high or more.</p>
    <p>People prepare for hurricanes in many ways. They board up windows. They buy food and water. Sometimes they leave their homes and go somewhere safe. This is called evacuation.</p>
    <p>Scientists track hurricanes using satellites and planes. They try to warn people before the storm hits. This gives families time to get ready and stay safe.</p>

  <h2 class="passage-title">Hurricanes: Nature's Most Powerful Storms</h2>
  <div class="passage-text">
    <p>A hurricane is one of nature's most powerful storms. These massive weather systems form over warm ocean water and can cause terrible damage when they reach land.</p>
    <p>Hurricanes begin when several conditions come together. The ocean water must be at least 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Warm, moist air rises from the ocean surface. As this air rises, it begins to rotate because of Earth's spin. More warm air rushes in to take its place. This cycle continues, and the storm grows stronger. When wind speeds reach 74 miles per hour, the storm officially becomes a hurricane.</p>
    <p>Every hurricane has a similar structure. At the very center is the eye, a calm area with light winds and clear skies. Surrounding the eye is the eyewall, which contains the most violent winds and heaviest rainfall. Spiral bands of thunderstorms extend outward from the eyewall for hundreds of miles.</p>
    <p>The Saffir-Simpson Scale measures hurricane strength using categories from 1 to 5. Category 1 hurricanes have winds between 74 and 95 miles per hour. Category 5 hurricanes, the most destructive, have winds exceeding 157 miles per hour. These extreme storms can level buildings and cause catastrophic damage.</p>
    <p>Hurricanes threaten coastal areas in multiple ways. Heavy rainfall causes inland flooding. Storm surge occurs when hurricane winds push ocean water onto shore. A major hurricane's storm surge can reach 20 feet or higher, flooding entire neighborhoods.</p>
    <p>Communities in hurricane zones take preparation seriously. Residents stock up on supplies, secure their homes, and follow evacuation orders when necessary. Meanwhile, meteorologists use satellites, radar, and hurricane hunter aircraft to track these storms and provide life-saving warnings.</p>

  <h2 class="passage-title">Hurricanes: Understanding Earth's Mightiest Storms</h2>
  <div class="passage-text">
    <p>Hurricanes rank among the most powerful and destructive natural phenomena on Earth. These rotating storm systems can span hundreds of miles and unleash devastating winds, torrential rainfall, and deadly storm surge on coastal communities.</p>
    <p>The formation of a hurricane requires specific atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Ocean water temperatures must reach at least 80 degrees Fahrenheit to a depth of about 150 feet. When warm, humid air rises rapidly from the ocean surface, it creates an area of low pressure. Surrounding air spirals inward to fill this void, and the Coriolis effect—caused by Earth's rotation—sets the system spinning. As the cycle of evaporation and condensation continues, the storm intensifies. Once sustained winds exceed 74 miles per hour, meteorologists classify the system as a hurricane.</p>
    <p>The anatomy of a hurricane reveals its organized structure. The eye, typically 20 to 40 miles in diameter, sits at the storm's center. Despite the chaos surrounding it, the eye remains relatively calm with minimal clouds and light winds. The eyewall immediately surrounding the eye contains the hurricane's most ferocious conditions—the strongest winds, heaviest precipitation, and most intense updrafts. Extending outward from the eyewall, spiral rainbands produce additional thunderstorms and tornadoes.</p>
    <p>Scientists categorize hurricanes using the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Category 1 storms bring dangerous winds of 74 to 95 miles per hour, while Category 5 hurricanes generate catastrophic winds exceeding 157 miles per hour. Each category increase represents significantly greater destructive potential.</p>
    <p>The hazards associated with hurricanes extend beyond wind damage. Storm surge—the abnormal rise of seawater driven ashore by the storm's winds—historically causes the greatest loss of life. Additionally, hurricanes produce tremendous rainfall, often dropping 6 to 12 inches or more, which triggers severe inland flooding.</p>
    <p>Preparation and early warning systems save countless lives each hurricane season. The National Hurricane Center monitors tropical weather using satellites, reconnaissance aircraft, and computer models to forecast storm tracks and intensity.</p>

  <h2 class="passage-title">Hurricanes: The Science Behind Nature's Heat Engines</h2>
  <div class="passage-text" style="font-size: 13px;">
    <p>Hurricanes represent some of the most awe-inspiring and destructive meteorological phenomena on our planet. These immense rotating storm systems function as massive heat engines that transfer thermal energy from tropical oceans to the atmosphere, unleashing tremendous destructive force in the process.</p>
    <p>The genesis of a hurricane depends upon a precise combination of atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Sea surface temperatures must reach approximately 80 degrees Fahrenheit to a substantial depth, typically around 150 feet, to provide sufficient thermal energy. When solar radiation heats tropical waters, evaporation accelerates dramatically. This warm, moisture-laden air rises rapidly, creating a center of low atmospheric pressure. As surrounding air rushes inward to equalize the pressure differential, the Coriolis effect—a consequence of Earth's rotation—deflects this air movement, initiating the characteristic counterclockwise rotation observed in Northern Hemisphere hurricanes.</p>
    <p>Structurally, a mature hurricane exhibits remarkable organization. The eye—generally spanning 20 to 40 miles in diameter—occupies the storm's rotational center. Paradoxically, this region experiences calm conditions, minimal cloud cover, and occasionally clear skies. Encircling the eye, the eyewall constitutes the most violent portion of the hurricane, characterized by towering cumulonimbus clouds, maximum sustained winds, and the most intense precipitation rates.</p>
    <p>Meteorologists employ the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale to communicate potential hurricane impacts. While Category 1 hurricanes (74-95 mph) produce some structural damage, Category 5 hurricanes (exceeding 157 mph) cause catastrophic destruction—demolishing residential structures, uprooting mature trees, and rendering impacted areas uninhabitable for extended periods.</p>
    <p>Storm surge constitutes the deadliest hurricane hazard, responsible for approximately half of all hurricane-related fatalities historically. This phenomenon occurs when powerful hurricane winds drive ocean water toward the coastline, producing a dome of seawater that can exceed 20 feet above normal tide levels.</p>
    <p>Modern hurricane forecasting has dramatically improved public safety through technological advancement. The National Hurricane Center synthesizes data from geostationary satellites, Doppler radar networks, oceanic buoys, and specialized reconnaissance aircraft.</p>

  <h2 class="passage-title">Hurricanes: Thermodynamic Giants and Their Societal Implications</h2>
  <div class="passage-text" style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.7;">
    <p>Hurricanes, known as typhoons in the western Pacific and cyclones in the Indian Ocean, constitute Earth's most energetically powerful atmospheric phenomena. These massive rotating storm systems function as thermodynamic engines of extraordinary efficiency, extracting heat energy from tropical ocean waters and converting it into kinetic energy manifested through destructive winds, torrential precipitation, and catastrophic storm surge.</p>
    <p>The thermodynamic processes underlying hurricane formation require a convergence of specific environmental conditions. Sea surface temperatures must attain approximately 26.5 degrees Celsius (roughly 80 degrees Fahrenheit) to a depth of at least 50 meters, providing the requisite thermal reservoir. When intense solar radiation heats equatorial waters, rapid evaporation transfers both moisture and latent heat to the overlying atmosphere. This warm, humid air ascends buoyantly, establishing a region of pronounced low pressure at the surface. The resulting pressure gradient accelerates surrounding air toward this low-pressure center, while the Coriolis force induces cyclonic rotation.</p>
    <p>Mature hurricanes exhibit distinctive structural characteristics reflecting the underlying dynamics. The eye—typically 30 to 65 kilometers in diameter—marks the rotational axis where subsiding air suppresses cloud formation. Encircling the eye, the eyewall comprises towering cumulonimbus convection reaching the tropopause, maximum tangential winds, and precipitation rates potentially exceeding 100 millimeters per hour.</p>
    <p>The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, while widely utilized for public communication, captures only the wind-related hazard dimension. Storm surge constitutes the deadliest hurricane hazard, responsible for approximately half of all hurricane-related mortality historically.</p>
    <p>Climate change projections suggest concerning modifications to future hurricane characteristics. While overall tropical cyclone frequency may remain stable, the proportion achieving major hurricane intensity appears likely to increase as oceanic heat content rises. These evolving threats necessitate continued investment in forecasting capabilities and resilient infrastructure design.</p>
